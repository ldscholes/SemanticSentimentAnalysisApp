Human Evaluation App for Semantic/Sentiment Analysis
==================================

App that allows for Human evaluation of comments as either positive/negative/neutral.

Introduction
------------

This app created from the Basic Activity template lets a user tap an product name
to make a choice. The app displays a list of comments related to that product.
The app also uses an intent so that when the user taps a comment, 
it launches a edit screen. The edit screen
demonstrates EditText input controls and radio buttons. This version
includes options for the app bar options menu, in which some of the
options appear as icons in the app bar. It also includes the Up navigation
button for the user to navigate back to the main activity.
